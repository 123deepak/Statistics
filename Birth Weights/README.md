##Birthweight reduced data set

*This dataset contains information on new born babies and their parents.  It contains mostly continuous variables (although some have only a few values e.g. number of cigarettes smoked per day) and is most useful for correlation and regression.  The birthweights of the babies who mothers smoked have been adjusted slightly to exaggerate the differences between mothers who smoked and didn’t smoke so students can see the difference more clearly in a scatterplot with gestational age and scatter colour coded by smoking status.   *
